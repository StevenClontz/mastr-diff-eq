# tbil-la exercises

These exercises are written for use with
<https://github.com/StevenClontz/Mastr>.
Scripts and templates are located in
`mastr`, and static files
(PreTeXt, LaTeX, HTML) are built to
`build`, using this
command :

```
bin/build PATH_TO_MASTR [mastr/standard]
```

where `PATH_TO_MASTR` designates where
the `PATH_TO_MASTR/mastr.sage` and 
`PATH_TO_MASTR/mastr.rb` files
are located on your machine. If `mastr/standard` is
provided (without brackets), then only that
standard will be built; otherwise all
standards will be built.
